# Newton's Laws of Motion

## First Law

An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction, unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.

## Second Law

The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force applied to it and inversely proportional to its mass. This is expressed mathematically as:

$$ F = ma $$

where F is the net force, m is the mass, and a is the acceleration.

## Third Law

For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This means that whenever one object exerts a force on another object, the second object exerts an equal and opposite force on the first object.

Newton's laws of motion form the basis of classical mechanics and are essential for understanding the behavior of objects in motion.
